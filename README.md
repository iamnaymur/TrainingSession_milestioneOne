Semantic Tags - We have to put different parts on our webpage to make our website look good and semantic tag helps us to understand about each part of a webpage and its meaning with the name in it. Ultimately it helps any person who wants to explore your codes and makes it easier for him/her.

Block elements - The contents in this blocks creates break and no other content can take place in the same line with the block elements. Some of the block elements are - "<div>, <p>, <ol>, <section>" and there are so many more.

Inline elements - An inline element does not block the space is has around it . Some inline elements are -" <span>, <a>, <button>, <input>, <textarea>."

Attributes- this is like an instruction for the elements we use. Suppose we are using the <a> element and we can use the href attribute to specify the path that will be used to send the user on the other webpage.
