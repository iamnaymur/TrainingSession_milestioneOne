Semantic Tags - We have to put different parts on our webpage to make our website look good and semantic tag helps us to understand about each part of a webpage and its meaning with the name in it. Ultimately it helps any person who wants to explore your codes and makes it easier for him/her.

Block elements - The contents in this blocks creates break and no other content can take place in the same line with the block elements. Some of the block elements are - "< div >, < p>, < ol>, < section>" and there are so many more.

Inline elements - An inline element does not block the space is has around it . Some inline elements are -" < span>, < a>, < button>, < input>, < textarea>."

Attributes- this is like an instruction for the elements we use. Suppose we are using the < a> element and we can use the href attribute to specify the path that will be used to send the user on the other webpage.

Types of css selectors- 
1 . Id selector - To select a specific element in the dom, we need to use "#".
2 . Class selector - We can select elements using the class selector by using "." before the class name that we given.
3 . Element selector - By using this you can target all the same elements, Suppose by using the < p> we can select all the p elements available file.
4 . Pseudo selector - Only targets elements based on an action. Example: a:hover
5 . Universal selector - (*) this targets all the elements on the page.
6 . Pseudo element selector - It targets specific part of an element.

Specificity - By this the browser can understand which style should be showed when there are different styles for the same thing. It looks up to the css selectors and then decide which specific style should it show on the display.


CSS box model - We can think of a rectangular box around every HTML element when we create one. This model is used to describe the height and width of the rectangular box. However, there are only 4 elements that describe the box model properly and they are Content, Padding, Border, Margin.

Flex and grid - Flex is one dimensional and it can only help you arrange items in a single row or a column. On the other hand grid system is two dimensional and you can imagine it like a table and grid is the most used system for styling complex design and layouts.

Media query - While making a webpage, it is always a big concern to make the webpage responsive for all the device sizes. This is where media query comes in and helps us to make the website responsive for the other devices and make a good user experience overall.
